Hi Martin!

Nice work! You've clearly shown a deep understanding of what you are trying to do. As you will see below you've almost ticked all the boxes.

I have to assess everybody equally, and while you've met the requirements for a Godkänt grade (and I'm 100% confident you have the understanding the fix the issues) unfortunately the mobile view has too many problems for this particular assignment to achieve a VG grade as it is right now.

I'd like you to fix the issues and resubmit (ie push to git hub and tell me to check it again), but I understand your health issues and how draining it must be, so I'll leave it up to you.

If you can find the time, focus and more importantly *desire* to get that VG grade please resubmit. It's just a grade though, so in the greater scheme of life it means absolutely nothing - you know what you are doing, I know you know what you are doing, so if you want to leave this as is that's perfectly fine. But if you want that grade take as much time as you like - the cut off date for refactoring is the end of the course, January next year, so there's no need to rush. Just let me know what you want to do.

BTW: you look different in real life compared to your profile pic!

    on the contact page the margin on section is pushing the footer off the page - margin is not included in height, so changing the margin to a padding will bring the footer into view.

Separate CSS:
  Semantic: ✅
    Not sure if it was intentional but this is very similar to the BEM convention. Very nice!

Semantic Element naming: ✅

  Comments should be removed unless they have semantic meaning, which in 99% of cases should be covered by the element classes
